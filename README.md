# Solar-Project
Training a computer vision model for detecting solar panel defects like bird drop, plants growing on panels, dust, shadowed areas and electrical damage. The first iteration is being done using YOLO and annotation are done using label-studio. The aim of the project is to detect these defects to find which solar panels are working efficiently.
